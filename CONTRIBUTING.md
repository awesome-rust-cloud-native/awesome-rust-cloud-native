# Contributing

This document contains workflows and guidelines for adding, editing, and removing projects from the list.

## Have something you want on the list? Let's add it!

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/awesome-rust-cloud-native/awesome-rust-cloud-native/issues) with any and all information.
Alternatively, you can [file a pull request](https://github.com/awesome-rust-cloud-native/awesome-rust-cloud-native/pulls) with either a linked issue or details of the project you are adding in the PR description.

## What "projects" are valid for this list?

"Project" can include anything related to cloud native Rust that has a corresponding URL and does not violate our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This includes code repositories, general "projects", podcasts, blogs, conferences, slides, Twitch/YouTube/Twitter accounts, videos, guides, books, and more.
We do not wish to limit the definition of "project", so if you are unsure about your submission, please file an issue anyway.

**Acceptance criteria includes the following:**

- _code-related projects_: must be primarily written in Rust with at least one primary use case relevant to "cloud native/infrastructure" software
- _non-code-related projects_: must be primarily related to Rust with at least one primary "theme" relevant to "cloud native/infrastructure" software
- has an available URL that's preferably non-versioned (e.g. `https://project-url/latest` instead of `https://project-url/0.1.0`)
- does not violate the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

While we are currently tackling project inclusion on a case-by-case basis, we understand that the acceptance criteria may be a bit broad.
Please feel free to suggestion improvements to the process via new issues.
