# Code of Conduct

This repository follows and enforces the Rust programming language's [Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).

1. Violations of the Code can (eventually or instantly) result in a block from the organization’s public repositories.
2. If Code violations occur “off-site”, stemming from our GitHub organization’s spaces, Rust Cloud Native members will inform adjacent community leaders of misconduct and refer to the above point for action.

## Definitions

- **off-site**: a physical or virtual space that is not managed by the GitHub organization (i.e. places that are not underneath the `https://github.com/rust-cloud-native` URL)
