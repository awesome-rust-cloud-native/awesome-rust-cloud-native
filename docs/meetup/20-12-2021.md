## Rust Cloud Native online meetup #1

*20 December 2021, 15:00 PDT, 00:00 CET*

This is the first meetup of the Rust Cloud Native initiative!

Let's meet online to talk about:

* the present and the future of RCN
* projects and topics you're interested in
* casual stuff afterwards :)

Meetup will take place on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/799cmsYB4q)
on the `meetup` voice channel.

Feel free to submit a pull request to the [rust-cloud-native.github.io repo](https://github.com/rust-cloud-native/rust-cloud-native.github.io)
if you want to propose any agenda items.

Rust Cloud Native meetups are going to be organized every month. Each month
the time slot is going to change between more AMER-friendly (like this one) and
more EMEA-friendly.

### Agenda

* **Intro** - introduction of the Rust Cloud Native initiative - why it exists,
  what are our goals, how we work, what projects we are interested in.
* **[lockc](https://rancher-sandbox.github.io/lockc/)** - ([@vadorovsky](https://twitter.com/vadorovsky))
  will talk about a project, written mostly in Rust, which aims to improve
  security of containers by providing more isolation between them and the host
  operating system. The main technology used is eBPF, so the talk is going to
  explain what it is and how it can be used with Rust. Future plans of rewriting
  the entire project in Rust are going to be mentioned as well.
* **Education/Training** - there is an idea to add a section about
  Education/Training to the RCN website in a form of
  [GitHub issue](https://github.com/rust-cloud-native/rust-cloud-native.github.io/issues/53).
  We are going to talk about how we want to do that.
* *Feel free to submit your talk proposal here*
* **Networking** - casual talk, an opportunity to talk about our interests and
  connect.
