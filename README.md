This is the main repository for the Rust Cloud Native organization on GitHub.
It contains the [website](https://rust-cloud-native.github.io), the [logo](./logo), goals, definitions, structures, processes, etc. for the organization.

## What is the mission of this organization?

Rust Cloud Native is focused on strictly one mission: **enabling the usage of Rust in the "Cloud", which refers to software related to infrastructure, containers, and Kubernetes.**

## What are the goals of this organization?

Adhering to the aforementioned mission includes the following:

1. Maintaining all active repositories
2. Promoting and improving the [website](https://rust-cloud-native.github.io) and its contents
3. Gathering community ideas and feedback via discussions and issues in order to determine the direction of the organization in a safe, public, and transparent manner

In the future, our organization may formalize on another goal: create an official [Rust working group](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance).
For now, we are focused on our aforementioned goals with the intent to provide a home for folks interested in cloud native Rust.

## What can I do to help?

In the short term, all we ask is your ideas, project additions, and feedback.
You can provide these by finding, filing and starting [issues](https://github.com/rust-cloud-native/rust-cloud-native.github.io/issues), [pull requests](https://github.com/rust-cloud-native/rust-cloud-native.github.io/pulls), and [discussions](https://github.com/rust-cloud-native/rust-cloud-native.github.io/discussions)!

This organization is our community's canvas.
Let's paint it.

## How do I add a project or resource?

Filing or boosting an issue will more than suffice.
However, you can refer to the [DEVELOPING](./DEVELOPING.md) file for help on submitting a pull request as well as more information on adding, editing and removing projects.

## How do I stay tuned for updates?

You can customize the "watch" settings for this repository to keep up with issues and discussions.
We will be exploring other avenues for providing updates in the future.

## Governance

The Rust Cloud Native GitHub organization's team members may help guide the course of the organization, but exist only to enable community voices and enact upon community consensus.
The organization team exists in a minimal capacity to represent the community _when needed_, and is volunteer-led.
Minimum "duties" include occasional PR and issue reviews as well as occasional involvement in team messaging platforms (e.g. our Discord sever).

Taking on more "duties" is optional, but encouraged and may include activities such as:
- organizing online (video and voice) meetups
- creating written content (e.g articles and blog posts about Rust Cloud Native
- maintaining a project which is officially affiliated with Rust Cloud Native (it is highly encouraged for new members to consider affiliating their maintained projects that fit the "cloud native Rust" criteria)
- administration of GitHub organization and repository (TBD by [#64](https://github.com/rust-cloud-native/rust-cloud-native.github.io/issues/64))
- administration or moderation of Discord server (TBD by [#64](https://github.com/rust-cloud-native/rust-cloud-native.github.io/issues/64))

To apply to become a member of the team, please fill out the application via the [GitHub issue template](https://github.com/rust-cloud-native/rust-cloud-native.github.io/issues/new).
You can nominate or self-request membership, and the only requirement is that you do not have a track record of consistent violations to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Decisions are made on the same public GitHub issues and not in private chats, meetings or forums.
Please feel free to open a [discussion](https://github.com/rust-cloud-native/rust-cloud-native.github.io/discussions) if you have any questions about the process.

## Code of Conduct

Unless otherwise specified, all repositories under the GitHub organization (including this one) follow and enforce this repository's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which follows the Rust programming language's [Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).

## Licenses

All contents of this repository are licensed under the [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license _except_ for the [logo](./logo) directory.

## Logo Usage

The [logo](./logo) is encouraged to be used wherever and whenever desired!

## Owners and Members

One of our first organizational objectives is to create a formal owners and members group with full access to the organization and its contents.
Humans do not scale, and Rust Cloud Native is for everyone.
The process to welcoming more members is still to be determined.

## Repository Style

Nothing is "required", but these style guidelines should help when creating and maintaining repositories within this organization.

- recommended documentation badge style (shields.io, etc.): `flat-square`
- root `README.md` files should embed the [logo](./logo)
- root `README.md` files should have a badge containing the repository's license(s)
- recommended licenses: [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
