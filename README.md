## What is the mission of this organization?

Rust Cloud Native is focused on strictly one mission: **enabling the usage of Rust in the "Cloud", which refers to software related to infrastructure, containers, and Kubernetes.**

## What are the goals of this organization?

Adhering to the aforementioned mission includes the following:

1. Maintaining all active repositories
2. Promoting and improving the [website](https://rust-cloud-native.github.io) and its contents
3. Gathering community ideas and feedback via discussions and issues in order to determine the direction of the organization in a safe, public, and transparent manner

In the future, our organization may formalize on another goal: create an official [Rust working group](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance).
For now, we are focused on our aforementioned goals with the intent to provide a home for folks interested in cloud native Rust.

## What can I do to help?

In the short term, all we ask is your ideas, project additions, and feedback.
You can provide these by finding, filing and starting [issues](https://github.com/rust-cloud-native/rust-cloud-native.github.io/issues), [pull requests](https://github.com/rust-cloud-native/rust-cloud-native.github.io/pulls), and [discussions](https://github.com/rust-cloud-native/rust-cloud-native.github.io/discussions)!

This organization is our community's canvas.
Let's paint it.

## How do I add a project or resource?

Filing or boosting an issue will more than suffice.
However, you can refer to the [DEVELOPING](./DEVELOPING.md) file for help on submitting a pull request as well as more information on adding, editing and removing projects.

## How do I stay tuned for updates?

You can customize the "watch" settings for this repository to keep up with issues and discussions.
We will be exploring other avenues for providing updates in the future.

## Logo Usage

The [logo](./logo) is encouraged to be used wherever and whenever desired!

## Owners and Members

One of our first organizational objectives is to create a formal owners and members group with full access to the organization and its contents.
Humans do not scale, and Rust Cloud Native is for everyone.
The process to welcoming more members is still to be determined.

## Repository Style

Nothing is "required", but these style guidelines should help when creating and maintaining repositories within this organization.

- recommended documentation badge style (shields.io, etc.): `flat-square`
- root `README.md` files should embed the [logo](./logo)
- root `README.md` files should have a badge containing the repository's license(s)
- recommended licenses: [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) or [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
